#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Linear run time O(n)
   - This is because it take n and runs it through the loop in order for the conditional to be met. 
   - As the size of the input increases the number or space used will grow at a slightly slower rate. :)


b) Linearithmic run time O(n log n)
    - I chose Linearithmic because of the range of the while loop increasing the amount of input increasing the amount of runtime.
    - As the size of the input increases the runtime or space used will grow at a slightly faster rate this solution is usable but might not be ideal. :|


c) Linear O(n) -- with recursion
    - There will still only be n operations 
    - As the size of the input increases the runtime or space used will grow at the same rate the solution is generally acceptable :)

## Exercise II
define a function taking in n as params 
create a variable that will store the safe values 
loop through range of n
see if the egg breaks
if the egg doesnt break, increment our variable
if the egg does break, exit the loop
return our variable

the runtime for this would be 
Linear O(n)
