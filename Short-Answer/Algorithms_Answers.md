#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Linear run time O(n)
   - This is because it take n and runs it through the loop in order for the conditional to be met. 
   - As the size of the input increases the number or space used will grow at a slightly slower rate. :)


b) Linearithmic run time O(n log n)
    - I chose Linearithmic because of the range of the while loop increasing the amount of input increasing the amount of runtime.
    - As the size of the input increases the runtime or space used will grow at a slightly faster rate this solution is usable but might not be ideal. :|
